--creating a new object with todo id as key, and the todo as the value
--then we are merging it with the old state
const temp = Object.assign(newState, { [action.todo.id]: action.todo});
--when rendering in jsx, use {} for code
-- input should be a self closing tag


//components can be functional or class << react.component
//below is functional style
const App = () => {
  return (<h1>meow</h1>);
};


Questions:
root.jsx: 6 //Why is it turning red saying unexpected token =>?
  -linter doesnt like destructuring
todo_actions.js: 8 //where will we be calling this action from? We are calling
receive todo in the todo_list_component
  --more so for backend call to grab todos for initial population
todo_list.jsx: 9//Why do we need a todo.id key for todolist item if they are different objects
  --they are not objects they are react components which are functions. Still need the key to differentiate them (check items on line 16)
